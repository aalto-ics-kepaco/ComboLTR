# comboLTR: Modeling drug combination effects via latent tensor reconstruction

## Overview

comboFM is a new polynomial regression-based framework for modeling anti-cancer effects of drug combinations in various doses and across different cancer cell lines. It is implemented in Python. 

The data used in the experiments is available on:
